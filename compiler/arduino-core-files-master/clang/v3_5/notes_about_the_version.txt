My intention was to build the 3.4 version. However, the python
bindings for that version mistake the left bracket with the right
bracket.

That's why I cloned the 3.5 version, which was still under development, from
the  llvm & clang repositories.

The last commits where:
    LLVM  - 743cf745309da49f1540f698f97eecc78126b5a3
    Clang - cb096de1de446dca9faa1db914dd0e464aec6ad7

I've attached the config.log too.
